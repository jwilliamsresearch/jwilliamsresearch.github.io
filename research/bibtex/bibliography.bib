We are specifically interested in the use of mobile tracking applications in this context to help design and deploy future technologies that can better support engaging leisure walks through synthesising previous behaviours and experiences. This survey collected 329 responses relating to self-reported walking behaviour patterns and mobile activity tracker use. In the emerging analysis we identified design considerations for future walking-focused applications, emphasizing the subjective and personal nature of walking routes.}, keywords={Mobile Activity Tracking; Walking Behaviour; Mobile Geospatial Computing}, eprint={}}

Existing work has often focused on recommending the quickest or most popular walks. However, these routes often lack detail on the contextual and experiential factors of walks and do not attempt to match the requirements with those of users. This article presents a vision of how more contextual detail can be applied to walking routes. We consider how existing analysis and spatial data mining techniques, including real-time clustering, viewshed analysis, and colocation patterns, could be used to extend a place-based understanding of leisure walking routes. By using spatial methods to extrapolate a rich platial understanding of the locations of a walk, the proposed methods in this article will support an emerging framework for curating engaging leisure walking experiences, recommending routes beyond those of the quickest or the most popular.}, keywords={Leisure Walking; Fuzzy Geospatial Data; Route Recommendations; Platial Information}, eprint={}}

In this paper, we present an emerging conceptual model of three scenarios for curating leisure walking route recommendations. Our recommendation scenarios consider the highest ranked similar walks, routes for new application users, and a progressively changing route recommendation scenario. Conceptual models for these scenarios are presented and the challenges in completing this research are considered. Feedback received on these early conceptual models will be used to further design a recommendation framework for curating engaging leisure walking experiences.}, keywords={Leisure Walking; Location Based Services; Route Recommendation; Mobile Geospatial Computing}, eprint={}}

A think-aloud study was conducted to explore what and how leisure walkers engaged with while walking. Our emerging results are presented in the context of an approach to extracting and understanding the platial experience during the study. The early findings suggest that the types of places engaged with while walking and the characteristics of these places are varied, while navigation and wayfinding have an impact on the selected route and the changes that occur during the walk. Our future work will now focus on further analysing these results and using them to improve the recommendation of leisure walking routes.}, keywords= {Leisure Walking; Platial Information; Think-aloud Study; Route Recommendation; Mobile Geospatial Computing}, eprint={}}

  abstract = {Investors are constantly looking for insights through comparisons on stock market data to
assist in the discovery of well-priced stocks. Modern stock market applications and research
allow for a range of visualizations to be produced whilst enabling the viewing of complete
datasets, however, these tools are often split, not providing queries and analysis in the same
view, therefore, limiting the potential of the proposed solution. Within this thesis, a new
system for performing analysis and comparison is proposed, a web-based application which
is able to assist in the exploratory visual analysis and visualization generation of financial
data. FinVis allows for over 500 stocks to be queried and 10,000 to be imported, before
displaying interactive and customizable visualizations to assist in the discovery of bargains
or good investments on the market. The application includes tools to save, store and load
queries alongside a visual analytic display to enable customization and more complex
individual views to be generated. A complete set of interactions are also provided to the
user, whilst enabling all of this exploration to take place with real-time and historical data
being provided through a financial API to the user’s web browser. The thesis enables future
work within the area of exploratory financial visualization to take place, providing core
concepts in a comparative nature to potential researchers and investors alike.}

abstract={This research investigates how a greater understanding of leisure walking can be used to support the personalisation and curation of new leisure walking experiences. Existing solutions are often limited in the range of routing properties a user has access to. The purpose of this research is to explore a richer understanding of how, what, why, and where leisure walkers engage with walks. Through a grounded theory approach combining a walking behaviour survey, a think-aloud study, and an expert interview study, a framework for personalising leisure walking route recommendations has been designed. The remaining work includes finalising the development of a web-based GIS demonstrator system for curating personalised routes and conducting an evaluation of this approach.},
